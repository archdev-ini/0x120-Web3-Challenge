## 🌐 About #0x120

**#0x120** is my 120-day mission to master Web3 development, from frontend foundations (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to blockchain-powered dApps (Solidity, Wagmi, IPFS). "0x" nods to Ethereum’s hex prefix, representing code, contracts, and my Web3 identity. "120" is the daily grind to launch something *game-changing*. Join me as I code, deploy, and reveal a secret project on-chain!

- **Start Date**: July 17, 2025  
- **End Date**: November 14, 2025  
- **Mission**: Become a Web3 full-stack developer, launching decentralized apps and a stealth platform.  
- **Follow**: [Your X Handle] on X with #0x120 | [Your Lens Profile] (coming soon)
